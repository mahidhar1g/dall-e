# AI Image Generation Web App (MERN Stack)

This project is a full-stack AI image generation web application inspired by tools like DALL-E. It allows users to generate images based on text prompts using OpenAI's DALL-E API. The project is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and GIT for version control.

## Features

- **AI Image Generation**: Generate images based on any text prompt using OpenAI's DALL-E API.
- **Dynamic Image Layout**: Display generated images in a visually appealing, responsive grid.
- **Search Functionality**: Search through the generated images using text queries.
- **"Surprise Me" Button**: Generate random images with the click of a button.
- **Download Option**: Download any image generated through the app.
- **Image Storage**: Images are stored using Cloudinary for optimized performance.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be fully responsive.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Vite for fast builds
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
